# Compiler-Design
Consists of lex codes and codes for various parsers.


LAB1:
1) C program to construct a DFA with ∑ = {0, 1} that accepts the languages ending with “01” over the characters {0, 1}
2) C program to accept set of all strings over binary alphabet containing even number of 0’s and even number of 1’s.

LAB2:
1) Implementation of Lexical analyzer using C

LAB3:
1) Identification of Vowels and Consonants
2) count number of vowels and consonants
3) Count the number of Lines in given input
4) Recognize strings ending with 00
5) Recognize a string with three consecutive 0’s

LAB4:
1) Implementation of lexical analyzer using LEX.

LAB5:
1) Lexical Analyzer for a language.

LAB6:
1) Implement Recursive Descent Parser.

LAB7:
1) Predictive parser.
